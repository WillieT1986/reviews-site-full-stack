package org.wecancodeit.columbus.reviewssitefullstack;

public class ReviewController {

	// Things to do
	// 1. Ask questions listed within ReviewsPopulator.
	// 2. Should I delete the Cat/Title constructor and try to add Category to the
	// larger constructor or is that fine still the way it is?
	// 3. To discover what goes within the ReviewController since there is the
	// ReviewsPopulator.
	// 4. Read over Instructions. Do I need more than just a review.html and a
	// reviews.html?
	// 5. How does this work with a single controller if at all? Part of question
	// #3.
	// 6. Feels like I am barely at 33% completion. Only if I look at this in 3
	// phases: Java/Jpa | Thymleaf/Web | HTML/CSS. Goal is to at least finish
	// Thymleaf/Web setup.
	// 7. When I run the H2 Console and run SELECT * FROM REVIEW, why does Category
	// id state null when all tests pass for id's?
